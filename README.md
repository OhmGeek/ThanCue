# ThanCue #
### For the music ###
Cue software designed by an Abba fan and someone who isn't as keen on Abba.

# Development Team
This software is being developed jointly by Mike Croall and Ryan Collins.

# Development Guidelines
Git wise, use the master branch for code that works perfectly i.e. release standard code. All development should occur on the dev branch, as this is the current dev standard branch of code. 

As this is Java, camelCase should be used for all variable names. ENUMS should be in upper case, and constants should also be in capital letters (with underscores separating words). All class names should start with a capitals

Interfaces for a given class should be notated with the suffix of -Interface. For example, Cue implements the CueInterface.

We are using Java8 and the development environment is IntelliJ. This is also being used for designing the GUI.
